# How to Run and Test
## To Run API:
Open VS Code and open folder "React-NodeJS-API-Example"
Open terminal via VSCode, after that run below commands in it
cd my-api
npm start

Note: the port number in the terminal output
example: "Server listening on the port::3090" 
in above example 3090 is the port number on which our API is running

## To Run APP:
Open Package.json file under my-app folder 
Look for below line in this file
""proxy": "http://localhost:3080""
If api port we noted when we ran API is different than what is mentioned in above line in Package.json, than mention the right port number.
For example: the port number we noted our api running was 3090 and in this my-app/Package.json file has 3080 than we replace 3080 with 3090.
Save Package.json file

now run below command to run app in new terminal window
cd my-app
npm start

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
